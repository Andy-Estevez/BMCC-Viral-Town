# Viral-Town
Viral Town is a virus simulation game where the player plays as the mayor, making decisions to save the town from a virus. Balancing between curing citizens of the virus and saving resources for more critical disasters, the player wins the game when the virus is eradicated and loses when all the citizens die or the town's resources run dry.
